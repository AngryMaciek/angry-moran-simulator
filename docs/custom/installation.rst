Installation
############

There are two preferable ways to install Moran [Py]cess: from the Python
Package Index or Anaconda Cloud service.

Install from Python Package Index
---------------------------------

The easiest way to install our Python package in the current environment is via the `pip` command (requires internet connection):
```bash
pip install moranpycess
```

All of the dependencies will be installed alongside automatically. Their versions are specified in the [setup configuration file](setup.cfg).

Install from Anaconda Cloud
---------------------------

Alternatively, if one uses _conda_ package manager, the software might be installed directly from Anaconda servers with:
```bash
conda install -c angrymaciek moranpycess
```

And again, the dependencies are taken care of by the package manager.  
Please beware that this installation method requires `conda>=4.3` version.

Alternatives
------------

setup.py and DockerHub.
